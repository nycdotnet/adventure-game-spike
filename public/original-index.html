  <p><b>Browser Support:</b> This game requires Canvas and Gamepad support, as well as a dual analog stick controller such as the XBox 360 contoller.  In Edge, it works with the XBox 360 contoller only (other controllers are not recognized).  In Chrome, the XBox 360 controller works, but Chrome does not properly handle the input on the third (shoot-y) axis from other controllers such as the Logitech RumblePad 2, so you can only shoot horizontally.  In Firefox, both the XBox 360 and Logitech RumblePad 2 controllers work correctly.  Safari and IE 11 do not support the Gamepad API as of December 2016.</p>
  <p><b>Instructions:</b> Keep shooting and don't let the grunts touch you.  Use the left-analog stick to move and the right-analog stick to shoot, both in 360Â°.  You may have to click the web page and a button or axis on your controller in order to start the game (Gamepad API is inconsistently implemented across browsers, Chrome may auto-start).   Free heart every 35,000 points.  Please send screenshots of your high scores to <a href="https://twitter.com/nycdotnet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Ognibene</a> on Twitter.  Refresh the page to start over.  Have fun!  :-)</p>
